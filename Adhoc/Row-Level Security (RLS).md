**What is Row-Level Security (RLS)?**

Row-Level Security (RLS) is a feature in Power BI that allows you to restrict data access for given users at the row level. Essentially, different users can view the same report but see different slices of data based on predefined rules. This ensures that users only see the data they are authorized to see, even if the underlying dataset contains more information.

**Why use RLS?**

1.  **Data Privacy & Compliance:** Essential for adhering to data privacy regulations (like GDPR, HIPAA) by ensuring users only access data relevant to their role or department.
2.  **Tailored User Experience:** Users see only the data pertinent to them, reducing clutter and making reports more relevant.
3.  **Simplified Report Management:** Instead of creating multiple versions of the same report for different user groups, you can create one report and apply RLS.
4.  **Security:** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information within a shared dataset.

**How RLS Works (Conceptual Flow):**

1.  **User Logs In:** A user signs into the Power BI service.
2.  **Identity Check:** Power BI identifies the user (typically via their User Principal Name - UPN, e.g., `user@company.com`).
3.  **Role Assignment:** The user is associated with one or more RLS roles defined for the dataset.
4.  **DAX Filter Application:** Each role has a DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) filter rule associated with it. This rule is applied to the relevant tables in the data model.
5.  **Data Filtering:** The DAX filter effectively acts like a `WHERE` clause in SQL, filtering the rows of data before they are presented in visuals.
6.  **View Restricted Data:** The user sees only the data rows that satisfy the DAX filter conditions for their assigned role(s).

**Types of RLS Implementation:**

1.  **Static RLS:**
    *   **Concept:** You define fixed rules directly in the DAX filter for a role. For example, a "EuropeSales" role might have a filter `[Region] = "Europe"`.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Define roles in Power BI Desktop.
        *   Write specific DAX filter expressions for each table within each role.
        *   Publish to Power BI Service.
        *   Assign users or security groups to these roles in the Power BI Service.
    *   **Pros:** Simple to set up for a small number of distinct, unchanging rules.
    *   **Cons:** Not scalable if you have many users with unique access needs or if rules change frequently. Managing many roles can become cumbersome.

2.  **Dynamic RLS:**
    *   **Concept:** The DAX filter uses functions like `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` or `USERNAME()` to filter data based on the logged-in user's identity. This often involves a separate mapping table that links users to the data dimensions they can access.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Typically, you have a table in your model that maps user UPNs (or other identifiers) to the data they should see (e.g., a `UserAccess` table with `UserEmail` and `Region` columns).
        *   Define a single (or few) role(s) in Power BI Desktop.
        *   The DAX filter for the role would look up the current user's UPN in the mapping table and filter the fact/dimension tables accordingly.
        *   Publish to Power BI Service.
        *   Assign users or security groups to this dynamic role.
    *   **Pros:** Highly scalable and flexible. Security rules are data-driven and can be updated by modifying the mapping table without republishing the PBIX file (if the mapping table is refreshed).
    *   **Cons:** Requires a bit more setup, including creating and maintaining the mapping table.

**Key DAX Functions for RLS:**

*   **`USERPRINCIPALNAME()`:** Returns the User Principal Name (UPN) of the logged-in user (e.g., `user@yourdomain.com`). This is the most common and recommended function for RLS in the Power BI service.
*   **`USERNAME()`:**
    *   In Power BI Desktop: Returns `DOMAIN\user`.
    *   In Power BI Service: Returns the UPN (same as `USERPRINCIPALNAME()`).
    *   It's generally safer to use `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` for consistency when targeting the Power BI Service.
*   **`LOOKUPVALUE(result_columnName, search_columnName, search_value [, search_columnName2, search_value2]...)`:** Useful in dynamic RLS to fetch a value from your user mapping table.
*   **`CONTAINSSTRING(within_text, find_text)`:** Checks if a string contains another string.
*   **`PATHCONTAINS(path, item)`:** Useful for hierarchical RLS (e.g., manager-employee hierarchy).
*   **`FILTER(table, filter_expression)`:** Can be used for more complex filtering logic.

**Step-by-Step Implementation (Power BI Desktop & Service):**

**Phase 1: Power BI Desktop**

1.  **Open your PBIX file.**
2.  **Go to the "Modeling" tab.**
3.  **Click "Manage Roles."**
    *   Click "Create" to define a new role (e.g., "Sales Manager," "Regional Analyst").
    *   Select the table you want to apply the filter to.
    *   In the "Table filter DAX expression" box, write your DAX filter.

    **Static RLS Example:**
    *   Role: `EuropeSales`
    *   Table: `Sales`
    *   DAX: `[SalesTerritoryRegion] = "Europe"`

    **Dynamic RLS Example (assuming a `DimEmployee` table with an `EmailAddress` column):**
    *   Role: `EmployeeData`
    *   Table: `FactSales` (assuming it has an `EmployeeKey` related to `DimEmployee`)
    *   DAX on `DimEmployee` table: `[EmailAddress] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()`
        *   *Note: The filter on `DimEmployee` will propagate to `FactSales` through the relationship.*

    **Dynamic RLS Example (using a separate `UserAccess` mapping table):**
    *   `UserAccess` table columns: `UserEmail`, `AccessibleRegion`
    *   `Sales` table column: `Region`
    *   Role: `DynamicRegionAccess`
    *   DAX on `Sales` table: `'Sales'[Region] = LOOKUPVALUE('UserAccess'[AccessibleRegion], 'UserAccess'[UserEmail], USERPRINCIPALNAME())`
        *   *This DAX expression filters the `Sales` table to show only rows where the `Region` matches the `AccessibleRegion` for the currently logged-in user, as defined in the `UserAccess` table.*

4.  **Click "Save."**
5.  **Test Roles in Desktop:**
    *   Still on the "Modeling" tab, click "View as."
    *   Check the box for the role you want to test.
    *   Optionally, you can also provide a UPN to test for a specific user (especially for dynamic RLS): check "Other user" and enter the UPN.
    *   Click "OK." Your report visuals will now be filtered as if you were that role/user.
    *   A yellow banner appears at the top: "Now viewing report as [RoleName]". Click "Stop viewing" to revert.

**Phase 2: Power BI Service**

1.  **Publish your PBIX file to the Power BI Service.**
2.  **Navigate to the Workspace where you published the report.**
3.  **Find your Dataset** (not the report). Click the ellipsis (...) next to the dataset name and select "Security."
4.  **Assign Users/Groups to Roles:**
    *   You'll see the roles you defined in Power BI Desktop.
    *   Select a role.
    *   In the "Members" box, type the email addresses of individual users, or the names of Azure Active Directory (AAD) security groups or Microsoft 365 groups.
    *   Click "Add," then "Save."
    *   *Best Practice:* Use security groups for easier management. Adding/removing users from the AAD group automatically updates their access in Power BI, without needing to modify RLS settings in the service.

5.  **Test Roles in Service:**
    *   On the same RLS security page in the service, click the ellipsis (...) next to a role name.
    *   Select "Test as role."
    *   This will open the associated report, filtered by that role.
    *   You can also test by providing a specific UPN if you want to see how a particular user would experience it.
    *   A blue banner appears at the top: "Now viewing as [RoleName]". Click "Back to Row-Level Security" to stop.

**Important Considerations & Best Practices:**

1.  **Workspace Roles vs. RLS:**
    *   Workspace roles (Admin, Member, Contributor) grant permissions to edit or manage content.
    *   Users with Admin, Member, or Contributor roles on the workspace *can see all data in the dataset by default when editing or creating new reports from it*, regardless of RLS rules.
    *   RLS primarily applies to users with the "Viewer" role in the workspace or users accessing reports/dashboards shared with them via Apps or direct sharing (who effectively have read-only access).
    *   If an Admin/Member/Contributor "Views" a report (as a consumer would), RLS *will* apply if they are assigned to an RLS role.

2.  **Performance:**
    *   Complex DAX filters can impact report performance. Keep them as simple as possible.
    *   Ensure your data model is well-designed (star schema is often best).
    *   Bi-directional relationships can sometimes have unintended consequences with RLS filter propagation. Test thoroughly.
    *   The `LOOKUPVALUE` approach for dynamic RLS is generally efficient if the mapping table is not excessively large and the columns are of appropriate data types.

3.  **`USERNAME()` vs. `USERPRINCIPALNAME()`:**
    *   Always prefer `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` for RLS in the Power BI Service. It's more consistent.
    *   `USERNAME()` might be needed if you're dealing with on-premises Analysis Services Live Connections with Windows authentication.

4.  **RLS and Q&A:** Q&A respects RLS. Users will only get answers based on the data they are authorized to see.

5.  **RLS and "Analyze in Excel":** When users use "Analyze in Excel" with a dataset that has RLS, the data they see in Excel will also be restricted by RLS.

6.  **RLS doesn't hide visuals or pages:** If a user has no data to see for a particular visual due to RLS, the visual will appear empty or show a "Can't display the visual" message. It doesn't hide the visual itself.

7.  **Caching:** Power BI employs caching mechanisms. RLS configurations are part of the cache key, so users with different RLS roles will get their own cached data.

8.  **Composite Models:** RLS can be defined on tables from different source groups in composite models. However, be mindful of how filters propagate, especially with DirectQuery sources. RLS on DirectQuery sources might rely on the source system's ability to handle the incoming filter queries efficiently.

9.  **DirectQuery and SSO:** For DirectQuery sources, if Single Sign-On (SSO) is configured, the RLS rules might be enforced by the underlying data source itself, based on the credentials of the Power BI user. If not using SSO, the credentials used to connect to the DirectQuery source will determine access, and Power BI RLS will apply on top of that.

10. **Documentation:** Clearly document your RLS roles, DAX logic, and user/group assignments.

**Limitations:**

*   RLS is not applied to workspace Admins, Members, or Contributors when they are *editing* reports or datasets, or creating new reports from the dataset. They can see all data. RLS applies to them when they are *viewing* reports as a consumer.
*   "Publish to web" does not support RLS (as it's anonymous access).
*   RLS cannot be defined on calculated tables that use `USERNAME` or `USERPRINCIPALNAME` in their definition *within Power BI Desktop*. However, once published, the DAX in RLS roles will evaluate correctly.
